## Overview

I am a data analyst with a strong focus on **SQL, Python, BI dashboards and data visualization**.  
My approach combines technical rigor, analytical clarity, and an emphasis on **communicating results that truly support decision-making**.

With a background bridging **data analytics and spatial analysis**, I work across the full analytical pipeline: data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, KPI design, dashboard building, and insight communication.

This portfolio presents projects that highlight my strengths in **analytics, ETL workflows, BI dashboards, and reproducible data processes**.
